Description             : "Durango" is a wad inspired by Dwango deathmatch
                          series wad. It has some funny references but is
                          completely deathmacth playable. Made by a hispanic
                          community from Argentina, Colombia, Spain, etc.
                          
                          The wad is meant to be played in ffa via Zdaemon in
                          honor of classic players who are still playing to
                          Dwango there. There are some personal memes and advanced
                          humor present along the wad that was built in the
                          community of Hunted11 (an Argentinian Doom
                          Youtuber). Hugo who appears in some textures of the
                          wad is one of the best hispanic deathmatch players.
