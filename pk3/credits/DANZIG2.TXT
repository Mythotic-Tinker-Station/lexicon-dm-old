                                  ideas and playtesting.  Tim and Tower 
                                  handled all of the weapon placements for 
                                  the TEAM deathmatch skill setting (Skill 3) 
                                  in Map20.  I would like to thank Tim for 
                                  all of his help in creating this series - 
                                  Tim was there in the beginning of Danzig, 
                                  and he's here in the end.  Thank you, Tim!

* Important Notes *

        Danzig2 is a set of five tight levels designed to provide for intense
two-, three-, or four-player DOOM ][ Deathmatches.  I've included support for 
various modes of play as follows (these support modes DO NOT apply to Map20;
see below for further details):
        
        1.  Original Deathmatch rules ("I'm Too Young To Die" and "Hey, Not 
            Too Rough" support this) 
            
        2.  Deathmatch 2.0 rules ("Hurt Me Plenty" supports this) 
        
        3.  What I call "Expert" mode ("Ultraviolent" and "Nightmare" support 
            this)  
        
Support for Deathmatch 2.0 has been altered from previous Danzig levels to 
better provide for -altdeath play.  Original Deathmatch is now basically the 
same setup as Expert mode without any plasma weapons.  Expert mode still has 
very little health and ammo, but DOES include almost every weapon in the level 
(including the BFG).  Use Expert mode if you want access to the more powerful 
weapons.
        I've also included monster support - monsters are placed 
strategically to add spice to the game.  Usually players don't need this in a 
three- or four-player game, but sometimes a two-person game can get a little 
slow.  Either way you like it, BE SURE TO INCLUDE THE RESPAWN OPTION WHEN 
USING MONSTERS in your Deathmatches.
        Also note that these levels do not involve cooperative exits; the
exits should be simple to find.
        

* Danzig20/Map20 *

        Map20 of this set (danzig20) is my final DOOM level.  WHEW!  Between 
the two of us, Brandon and I have now released 20 pwads for DOOM II Death-
match.  We've both learned a lot since the early levels of the old Igor 
Series, and hope you've enjoyed this second series of deathmatch pwads.  
        As you'll notice, Map20 contains bits and pieces of ideas from our 
previous levels - a sort of recap of our work.  You'll see features from 
Igor9 Map06, Danzig11, Danzig13, Danzig14, Danzig15, Danzig16, as well as 
various other ideas.  Obviously Map20 is larger than previous Danzig levels;    
this is to accomodate 1) team play, in which players need more room to 
maneuver and plan joint strategies, and 2) tournament play - when 
creating Map20, I had a tournament layout in mind.  Thus, while Map20 may not
promote the furiously fast-paced fragfests of previous Danzigs, it WILL force 
you to use skill and strategy - especially the Skill 1/2 difficulty setting.
        Please note that some minor changes have occured in THING placements 
with respect to the difficulty levels in Map20.  Skills 1&2 still support 
Original Deathmatch rules, but now contain NO supershotguns - only shotguns, 
chainguns, and rocket launchers (like E1Mx of Original DOOM).  Skill 3 is set 
up to support TEAM deathmatch, and includes all of the weapons in locations 
optimized for TEAM play.  Skills 4&5 still include all weapons but little 
health/armor/ammo.
        Theme for Map20 is somewhat of a departure from the last four or five
levels of this series, and more of a return to the older TECH style used in 
early Danzig and Igor pwads.  I had a futuristic warehouse in mind when 
creating Map20, with an older "original" area which was expanded to include 
a newer area; by looking carefully, you'll notice that the level seems 
split into these two different areas.  One area is older looking, with many 
brown, dirty textures and some old crates lying around.  The other area 
appears newer, with crisper textures and inset computer terminals.  Also, 
ample lighting should prevent any confusion over uniform colors when playing 
team matches.
     
        Finally, while concessions were necessary to incorporate both free-
for-all AND team play into one level, we hope Map20 proves fairly well-rounded 
and playable.  We also hope Map20 provides a satisfactory ending to a series 
that Brandon and I have thoroughly enjoyed creating (and hopefully you've 
enjoyed playing!).  Please feel free to send any comments/suggestions, as we 
look forward to some final feedback.   
        As always, thanks for using Danzig.  
        
        FINALLY finally, as of this writing, TIMinator and I are considering
a JOINT deathmatch pwad series - one in which we'll both contribute ideas 
in creating pwads.  This series would encompass Map21 through Map30 of 
DOOM ][ and would be called J****.  So maybe I'm not done with DOOM yet... ;)
